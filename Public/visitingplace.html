    The name Darjeeling comes from two Tibetan words 'Dorje', meaning
    thunderbolt and 'ling', means a place or land. Before being invaded by the
    Gorkhas of Nepal in the 1790s, Darjeeling was largely under the Kingdom of
    Sikkim and native tribes named Lepchas were the original inhabitants of the
    place. Under the Sugauli Treaty of 1815 CE, Nepal yielded one-third of their
    lands to the British, who established Darjeeling as the summer capital of
    Bengal Presidency. During 19th century AD, they set up a sanatorium and a
    military depot in Darjeeling. Later, extensive tea plantations were
    established in the region by the British. After independence, in 1947,
    Darjeeling was merged with West Bengal.

    Amidst the backdrop of the mighty snow-clad Himalayan peaks, Darjeeling is
    famous for its tea plantations, spectacular views of snow-capped peaks and
    Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The majestic Kanchenjunga, third highest
    mountain in the world, towers over this beautiful hill town. The toy train,
    among the major attractions of Darjeeling, was built in the late 19th
    century and runs from Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling. It was declared as a World
    Heritage Site in 1999 and is one of the few steam engines still in service
    in India. One can get a breathtaking view of the valleys and the hills while
    taking the ride.

  <p>
    Kolkata (spelled Calcutta before 1 January 2001) is the capital city of the
    Indian state of West Bengal. It is the second largest city in India after
    Mumbai.[2] It is on the east bank of the River Hooghly.[3] When it is called
    Calcutta, it includes the suburbs. This makes it the third largest city of
    India. This also makes it the world's 8th largest metropolitan area as
    defined by the United Nations.[4] Kolkata served as the capital of India
    during the British Raj until 1911. Kolkata was once the center of industry
    and education. However, it has witnessed political violence and economic
    problems since 1954. Since 2000, Kolkata has grown due to economic growth.
    Like other metropolitan cities in India, Kolkata struggles with poverty,
    pollution and traffic congestion.
